# UE5 First-Person Melee Combat Game -- Sprint 2

This repository contains the project developed during the second sprint
at Epitech Berlin, where we were tasked with creating a First-Person Shooter (FPS)
in Unreal Engine 5 over the course of 6 weeks.

We decided to reinterpret the FPS theme with melee-focused combat inspired by Mount & Blade,
placing the player in the role of a village guard seeking revenge after a devastating bandit raid.

## 🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics

Our core focus this sprint is building a solid melee combat foundation with a
directional attack and parry system.

Key mechanics include:
- First-person melee combat (Mount & Blade–style directional attacks)
- Attack directions: left, right, top, and bottom swings
- Directional blocking & parries matching incoming attacks
- etc...

## 📦 Required Asset Packs

The project relies on several free asset packs. If you want to open and
